# Transformers-and-NLP
# NLP Tasks with Keras NLP and Hugging Face

This repository contains three Colab notebooks demonstrating fundamental NLP patterns using **Keras NLP** and **Hugging Face Transformers**. Each notebook focuses on a distinct task:

1. **Inference with Pretrained Classifiers**
2. **Fine-tuning Pretrained Backbones**
3. **Building Transformers from Scratch**

Each notebook is paired with a **video walkthrough** that includes code explanations and debug traces.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebooks Overview

### 1. Inference with a Pretrained Classifier
- **Notebook**: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PW1ycOEGEl6_EPZdAY2ojK1KFJY2ZRVh?usp=sharing
- **Description**: Demonstrates how to use pretrained models for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and text generation.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Loading pretrained models from Keras NLP or Hugging Face
  - Preprocessing input text
  - Generating predictions and interpreting outputs

### 2. Fine-tuning a Pretrained Backbone
- **Notebook**: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Up9ri57hsTjIVemFTdo4-jAx2wKmEKlh?usp=sharing
- **Description**: Fine-tunes a transformer model (e.g., BERT) for a specific downstream task such as sentiment analysis.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Transfer learning and model adaptation
  - Tokenization and dataset preparation
  - Evaluation and performance tracking

### 3. Building a Transformer from Scratch
- **Notebook**: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1D7FBntdfdhRlx0sZam7EWtEMpehQxW9V?usp=sharing
- **Description**: Implements a custom Transformer architecture for text classification to gain deep understanding of its components.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Self-attention and multi-head attention
  - Positional encoding
  - Encoder structure and training
